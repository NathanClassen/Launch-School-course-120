Exercise 1

  We create objects by creating new instances of a class.
    
    ex. string_object = String.new
        string_object = "This is a string object"

  Terminology correction.. We instantiate the object.

Exercise 2

  A module is a collection of functionality that can be "mixed in" to a class.

  Modules are another way to achieve polymorphism. The purpose of Modules is to make sectioned off data, reusable chunks of data, available to other classes and objects.

  We use Modules by creating a mixin..mixing them into classes via the include method

    ex. module SportsPackage
          def turbo
            acceleration += 4
          end
          def nitrous
            max_speed += 50
          end
        end

        class Car
          include SportsPackage
        end
